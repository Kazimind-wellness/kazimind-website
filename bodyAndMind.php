                    <strong>The Mind-Body Connection</strong>  
                    refers to the relationship between our mental health and physical health. This relationship can help 
                    us gain a better understanding of many other issues, including anxiety, depression, trauma, chronic illness, 
                    and stress, to name a few. At The Kazimind Wellness centre, we are prepared to provide holistic 
                    care that supports your mind and your body.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">What is the Mind-Body Connection?</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    <strong>The Mind-Body Connection</strong>  encompasses how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are linked to our physical 
                    health. This is sometimes described as a feedback loop, meaning that physical responses such as pain influence 
                    how we think and feel, and vice versa. Sometimes we see our emotions manifest as physical reactions, such as 
                    anxiety resulting in sweaty palms and increased heart rate.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>The Body</strong> involves our physical abilities and reactions. We rely on physical functions such as walking, digestion, 
                    and fine motor skills to complete our daily routines, thus having a healthy body is important. Underlying these functions 
                    are many important systems, including the nervous system and endocrine system. These allow us sense what is happening internally 
                    and in the world around us. For example, when you touch a hot stove you experience pain, pull your hand away, and may have a burn. 
                    This reaction keeps us safe physically, but it also elicits an emotional response such as fear or anger. We also learn to be careful 
                    around the stove from this experience. This is where the mind comes in. 
                    <br><br>    
                    <strong>The Mind</strong> includes aspects that make us unique, including, our personality, spirit, and belief system. These influence our 
                    perception of the world around us. As we experience events in life, big or small, our mind and body respond. A particularly 
                    difficult experience may result in trauma which manifests in many ways. 
                    <br><br>
                    As science progresses, we see more and more how the mind and body are interconnected, making it difficult to separate one from the other. 
                    As a result, it is necessary to treat the mind and body as a whole when considering both mental and physical health issues.

                <p class="description">
                 Often times we find ourselves running on “auto-pilot” so we lose touch with what our body is telling us. Working with a 
                 therapist can help you tune back into your mind and body to understand what they need. Our office has a number of practitioners 
                 who integrate the mind-body connection into their work, all of whom you can view below. Once your professional has met with you and 
                 learned about your experiences, they will work with you to develop a plan that supports your physical and mental health. Support is 
                 most effective when there is a strong connection between the practitioner and client, and because of that, we encourage you to connect 
                 with as many practitioners as you need to ensure the best fit. All of our therapists who work with mind-body connection can be seen below.
