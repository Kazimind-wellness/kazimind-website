<h1 class="therapy-heading">Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy</h1>

<p class="reiki">
   Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy is a soft touch and subtle alternative healing modality that allows our bodies
    to return to a sense of wholeness and health. It can help us to come into relationship with our bodies allowing 
    the space to process. This helps to restore balance and health to our nervous system, musculoskeletal system, 
    circulatory system and organs to name a few.

                Online Body Wisdom sessions are offered when you arenâ€™t able to come into the office for 
                a Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy appointment as a way to help you connect with what is 
                happening in your system. Together, we explore the sensations and feelings you are noticing 
                and support you in being with them. Often, being present with your body sensations and feelings 
                can allow for transformation to occur.
