                <p class="intro-paragraph">
                <strong>Children</strong> and <strong>Youth</strong> may come to therapy either on their own or with the support of caregivers to work through a variety of challenges, such as <strong>bullying</strong>, <strong>trauma</strong>, <strong>family or sibling dynamics</strong>, <strong>faith or cultural concerns</strong>, <strong>school attendance issues</strong>, <strong>identity development</strong>, <strong>emotional regulation</strong>, and more. Every child has their own unique needs, so finding the right <strong>therapist</strong> is key. At our centre, we have a diverse team of <strong>therapists</strong> who work with children and youth, and we’ll help match your child with someone they feel safe with and can open up to.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">At What Age Does Kazimind Consider Someone a Child?</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    In Kenya, there is no universally defined legal age for health care decision-making. At <strong>Kazimind Wellness Centre</strong>, we consider anyone under the age of <strong>16</strong> to be a <strong>child</strong>. This means clients under 16 require <strong>consent from a legal caregiver</strong> to access therapy, and caregivers also have access to their file and session details.

                    <br><br>

                    However, research shows that concerns about <strong>privacy</strong> are a major reason teens avoid seeking support. For that reason, even if you have access to your child’s therapy information, we encourage you to respect their privacy and allow the therapy space to remain confidential whenever possible.

                    <br><br>

                    For clients <strong>aged 16 and above</strong>, we treat them as adult clients. They can consent to therapy on their own, and any information in their file is private and can only be shared with caregivers or others if they provide consent.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">What Does Child or Youth Therapy Look Like?</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Therapy for <strong>children and youth</strong> varies based on age, developmental level, and individual needs. Some may benefit from traditional talk therapy, while others respond better to non-verbal approaches like <strong>play, art, or sandtray therapy</strong>. Just like with adults, the initial sessions are focused on building trust, setting goals with the child and caregivers, and gathering background through assessment.

                <br><br>

                Some young clients may take longer to open up—especially those who have experienced <strong>trauma</strong> or <strong>attachment-related challenges</strong>. In these cases, therapy might begin with shorter sessions or include a caregiver in the room until the child feels more comfortable.

                <br><br>

                Therapists may use either <strong>directive</strong> or <strong>non-directive</strong> approaches. In <strong>directive play therapy</strong>, the therapist guides the session using selected activities to help the child express emotions and practice problem-solving. In <strong>non-directive play therapy</strong>, the child leads the play while the therapist offers a safe, accepting presence—allowing the child to explore feelings and challenges at their own pace.

                <br><br>

                Curious about the role of play in therapy? We often recommend a short video for caregivers that explains how children use play to communicate and make sense of the world.

                    bringing them to therapy. <strong>Therapy</strong> is most effective when there’s a strong relationship between the child or youth and their <strong>therapist</strong>,
