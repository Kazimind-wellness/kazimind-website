                <p class="description">
                    <strong>Stress</strong> is the body and mind’s natural response to life’s challenges. While it’s a normal part of difficult situations, <strong>stress</strong> can also signal that you're overwhelmed or that your needs aren’t being met. Its effects can show up on a <strong>mental</strong>, <strong>physical</strong>, and <strong>emotional</strong> level. Recognizing these signs is the first step in <strong>stress management</strong>, followed by learning practical skills to cope and regain balance.
                    <br> <br>


                   On a <strong>mental</strong> level, <strong>stress</strong> can appear as difficulty concentrating, trouble sleeping, or brain fog. Over time, these symptoms may significantly affect your ability to function day to day. <strong>Physical</strong> symptoms can also arise, such as muscle tension, headaches, or an upset stomach. Emotionally, <strong>stress</strong> may lead to feelings of <strong>anxiety</strong>, <strong>irritability</strong>, or <strong>depression</strong>. If left unmanaged, these symptoms can worsen and, in some cases, become overwhelming or debilitating.
